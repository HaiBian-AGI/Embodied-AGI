# AGI & Embodied Intelligence: Architecture Design and Engineering Implementation

This repository is the official engineering implementation library for the book **"The Origin of New Species: Engineering Implementation of AGI and Embodied Intelligence" (2026)**. Our goal is to transform the systematic theories regarding AGI and embodied intelligence into a runnable, verifiable "Machine Life" system.

### 🧭 Why do you need this "Navigational Chart"?

In a traditional e-commerce system, you can clearly define concepts like **Products, Orders, Shopping Carts, Payments, and Pending Payments**. This is because you are an expert in that domain; you understand the business logic, possess a global perspective, and know exactly which stage, data structure, or state type each concept corresponds to.

However, in an **AGI system**, can you clearly distinguish and interconnect the following?

> **Self, Ego, Consciousness, Learning, Self-learning, Self-research, Practice, Imitation, Cognition, Recognition, Knowledge, Reasoning, Logical Reasoning, Causal Reasoning, Experience, Interests, Hobbies, Thought, Thinking, Idea, Reflection, Train of Thought, Mindset, Emotion, Mood, Temperament, Character, Task, Goal, Decision, Choice, Judgment, Summary, Induction, Memory, Association...**

When these concepts are as blurred as a thick fog, how can you find the right course to design an AGI system?

From the perspective of software engineering, the author acts as a domain expert in a "Brain Factory," engaging in dialogue with developers to step-by-step explain various concepts and their mutual relationships in the field of AI. This project reveals how these concepts operate along the "assembly line" of the Brain Factory, explaining the underlying principles, mechanisms, and engineering implementation methods.

This is not just a book—it is a **Navigational Chart for AGI**. It grants you a global perspective to scrutinize industry designs, see through the surface to the essence, and quickly identify strengths and flaws. By gaining a systemic and process-oriented understanding of the nature of AI, you can become an outstanding AGI Architect.

### 🏗 Engineering Practice: From Logic to Code

This repository will progressively implement the following core modules based on the theories in the book:

-   **World Modeling:** A structured representation of the physical world. Starting from raw cognitive data, it builds a multi-dimensional "skyscraper" of the physical world with a defined structure.
    
-   **Inherent Motivation & Will:** Establishing an endogenous mechanism for goals, achieving a transition from "passive execution" to "active will."
    
-   **General Emotions & Tasks:** Simulating the process of emotional generation, unifying emotional experiences and general task requirements within a single algorithmic framework.
    
-   **Life Design:** Constructing the underlying infrastructure of machine values, which is the origin of achieving AGI universality.

### 📚 The Essential Blueprint for Developers

If you are building autonomous agents but find your architecture cluttered and your direction blurred, you need to open this **"User Manual for New Species."**

-   **Eliminate Design Bias:** Clarify and unify core concepts that have long been misused or misunderstood, defining their exact roles within the system.
    
-   **Bottom-Up Construction:** Starting from machine life, functional algorithms, and data structures, we build the machine's self, consciousness, emotion, thought, and will. **This is fundamentally different from the top-down, statistical approach of Large Language Models.**
    
-   **Solve Engineering Pain Points:** Address the bottlenecks of insufficient universality and the challenges of real-world deployment in embodied intelligence.
    

#### 💡 An Honest Note on Value and Pricing

You might ask: since this is an open-source repository, why is the core logic gated behind a purchase? As developers, we know that the most expensive cost in the AGI field is not computing power, but **incorrect underlying logic.**

-   **The Pitfall Guide:** This **$59.99** blueprint is designed to help you avoid tens of thousands of dollars in R&D dead ends. We believe a serious engineering design deserves to be treated with seriousness.
    
-   **Sustainable Research:** Proceeds from the book are dedicated to supporting the ongoing engineering verification of the core AGI architecture and the long-term technical evolution of this project.
    
-   **Filtering Co-builders:** Through this method, I seek peers who are truly willing to reconstruct machine life from the ground up.
